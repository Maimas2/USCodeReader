<content>A manufacturer of automobiles commits a violation if the manufacturer fails to comply with an applicable average fuel economy standard under <ref>section 32902 of this title</ref>. Compliance is determined after considering credits available to the manufacturer under <ref>section 32903 of this title</ref>. If average fuel economy calculations under <ref>section 32904(c) of this title</ref> indicate that a manufacturer has violated this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct a proceeding, with an opportunity for a hearing on the record, to decide whether a violation has been committed. The Secretary may not conduct the proceeding if further measurements of fuel economy, further calculations of average fuel economy, or other information indicates a violation has not been committed. The results of the measurements and calculations and the information shall be published in the Federal Register. Any interested person may participate in a proceeding under this subsection.</content>
