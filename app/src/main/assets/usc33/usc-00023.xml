<content> Investment in a strong program of integrated research, education, extension, training, technology transfer, and public service is essential for this strategy.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> The expanding use and development of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources resulting from growing coastal area populations and the increasing pressures on the coastal and Great Lakes environment challenge the ability of the United States to manage such resources wisely.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> The vitality of the Nation and the quality of life of its citizens depend increasingly on the understanding, assessment, development, management, utilization, and conservation of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources. These resources supply food, energy, and minerals and contribute to human health, the quality of the environment, national security, and the enhancement of commerce.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> The understanding, assessment, development, management, utilization, and conservation of such resources require a broad commitment and an intense involvement on the part of the Federal Government in continuing partnership with State and local governments, private industry, universities, organizations, and individuals concerned with or affected by ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the national sea grant college program, offers the most suitable locus and means for such commitment and engagement through the promotion of activities that will result in greater such understanding, assessment, development, management, management,<ref class="footnoteRef" idref="fn002047">1</ref> utilization, and conservation of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources. The most cost-effective way to promote such activities is through continued and increased Federal support of the establishment, development, management, and operation of programs and projects by sea grant colleges, sea grant institutes, and other institutions, including strong collaborations between Administration scientists and research and outreach personnel at academic institutions.</content>
