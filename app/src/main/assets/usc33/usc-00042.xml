<num>(B)</num>

<subparagraph class="indent2">

<content> such a mechanism presently exists at the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands and this terminal should serve as a model for others;</content>

<content> because of the effective partnership that has developed at Sullom Voe, Sullom Voe is considered the safest terminal in Europe;</content>
