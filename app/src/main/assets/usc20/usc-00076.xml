<heading> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">Congress finds the following:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was organized as a nation and internationally recognized as a nation by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and navigation.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous people in Hawaii in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawaii.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom of Hawaii to govern friendship, commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally recognized, and indigenous government of Hawaii, the Kingdom of Hawaii, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, including United States citizens, who were assisted in their efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. Because of the participation of United States agents and citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in 1993 the United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination through <ref>Public Law 103–150</ref> (<ref>107 Stat. 1510</ref>).</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> In 1898, the joint resolution entitled “Joint Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States”, approved <date date="1898-07-07">July 7, 1898</date> (<ref>30 Stat. 750</ref>), ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of Hawaii, including the government and crown lands of the former Kingdom of Hawaii, to the United States, but mandated that revenue generated from the lands be used “solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes”.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, and in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (<ref>42 Stat. 108</ref>), which designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<content> Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: “One thing that impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in poverty.”.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(9)</num>
<content> In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of <date date="1938-06-20">June 20, 1938</date> (<ref>52 Stat. 781</ref>, chapter 530; <ref>16 U.S.C. 391b</ref>, 391b–1, 392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit fishing in the area “only by native Hawaiian residents of said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their guidance.”.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(10)</num>
<content> Under the Act entitled “An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union”, approved <date date="1959-03-18">March 18, 1959</date> (<ref>73 Stat. 4</ref>), the United States transferred responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments to such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such Act.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(11)</num>
<content> In 1959, under the Act entitled “An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union”, the United States also ceded to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands formerly held by the United States, but mandated that such lands be held by the State “in public trust” and reaffirmed the special relationship that existed between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the legal responsibility to enforce the public trust responsibility of the State of Hawaii for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.</content>

<heading> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">Congress finds and declares the following:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> It is the policy of the Federal Government to maximize the leadership of and participation by Alaska Natives in the planning and the management of Alaska Native education programs and to support efforts developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for all students.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Many Alaska Native children enter and exit school with serious educational disadvantages.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> Overcoming the magnitude of the geographic challenges, historical inequities, and other barriers to successfully improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native students in rural, village, and urban settings is challenging. Significant disparities between academic achievement of Alaska Native students and non-Native students continue, including lower graduation rates, increased school dropout rates, and lower achievement scores on standardized tests.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> The preservation of Alaska Native cultures and languages and the integration of Alaska Native cultures and languages into education, positive identity development for Alaska Native students, and local, place-based, and culture-based programming are critical to the attainment of educational success and the long-term well-being of Alaska Native students.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> Improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native students increases access to employment opportunities.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> The Federal Government should lend support to efforts developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for Alaska Native students. In 1983, pursuant to <ref>Public Law 98–63</ref>, Alaska ceased to receive educational funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Bureau of Indian Education does not operate any schools in Alaska, nor operate or fund Alaska Native education programs. The program under this part supports the Federal trust responsibility of the United States to Alaska Natives.</content>
