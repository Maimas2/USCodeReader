<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to participate in or contribute to society. Improving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.</content>

<num>(2)</num>
<chapeau> Before the date of enactment of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (<ref>Public Law 94–142</ref>), the educational needs of millions of children with disabilities were not being fully met because—</chapeau>

<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(C)</num>
<content> undiagnosed disabilities prevented the children from having a successful educational experience; or</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(D)</num>
<content> a lack of adequate resources within the public school system forced families to find services outside the public school system.</content>
</subparagraph>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> Since the enactment and implementation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this chapter has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education and in improving educational results for children with disabilities.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> However, the implementation of this chapter has been impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching and learning for children with disabilities.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">

<num>(6)</num>
<content> While States, local educational agencies, and educational service agencies are primarily responsible for providing an education for all children with disabilities, it is in the national interest that the Federal Government have a supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to educate children with disabilities in order to improve results for such children and to ensure equal protection of the law.</content>
