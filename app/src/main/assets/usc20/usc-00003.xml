Moneys in the Fund shall be used exclusively to retire the obligations of the Board incurred under subsection (a) of this section. Adjustments of not greater than plus or minus 5 per centum may be made from time to time in the annual payments to the Fund in order to correct any gains or deficiencies as a result of fluctuations in interest rates over the life of the investments: <i>Provided, however</i>, That a final adjustment shall be made between the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury at the end of the amortization period to correct any overall gain or deficiency in the Fund.

<heading class="bold"> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">Congress finds as follows:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> A fundamental principle of American democracy is that individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and fight for justice.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> The actions of those who participated in the Civil Rights movement from the 1950s through the 1960s are a shining example of this principle in action, demonstrated in events as varied as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the drive for voting rights in Mississippi, and the March to Selma.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> While the Civil Rights movement had many visible leaders, including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks, there were many others whose impact and experience were just as important to the cause but who are not as well known.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess an invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the movement, and the recording of the retelling of their stories and memories will provide a rich, detailed history of our Nation during an important and tumultuous period.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> It is in the Nation’s interest to undertake a project to collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil Rights movement so future generations will be able to learn of their struggle and sacrifice through primary-source, eyewitness material. A coordinated Federal project would also focus attention on the efforts undertaken by various public and private entities to collect and interpret articles in all formats relating to the Civil Rights movement, and serve as a model for future projects undertaken in museums, libraries, and universities throughout the Nation.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution are appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make available to the public a collection of these oral histories. The Library and Smithsonian have expertise in the management of documentation projects, and experience in the development of cultural and educational programs for the public.</content>
</paragraph>

<subsection class="indent2 firstIndent-2">
<num class="bold">(b)</num>
<heading class="bold"> Purpose</heading>
<content>
<p class="indent0">It is the purpose of this subchapter to create a new federally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will coordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights movement that will build upon and complement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, and to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of such individuals so that Americans of all current and future generations may hear from them directly and better appreciate the sacrifices they made.</p>

<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> Since its founding, the United States has greatly benefitted from the contributions of women.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<chapeau> Historical accounts, monuments, memorials, and museums disproportionately represent men’s achievements and contributions and often neglect those of women. For example—</chapeau>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(A)</num>
<content> a study of 18 United States history textbooks concluded that 10 percent of the material documented contributions of women;</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(B)</num>
<content> 9 statues out of 91 in the United States Capitol’s National Statuary Hall depict women; and</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(C)</num>
<content> only one of the 44 monuments operated by the National Park Service specifically honors the achievements of women after the 2016 designation of the Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument.</content>
</subparagraph>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> There exists no national museum in the United States that is devoted to the documentation of women’s contributions throughout the Nation’s history.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> On <date date="2014-12-19">December 19, 2014</date>, Congress created a Congressional Commission to study the potential for an American museum of women’s history. The bipartisan Commission unanimously concluded that the United States needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in the United States.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> A comprehensive women’s history museum would document the full spectrum of the experiences of women in the United States, represent a diverse range of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds, more accurately depict the history of the United States, and add value to the Smithsonian Institution.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> The collections, exhibits, historical narrative materials, and museum programming of the women’s history museum should be inclusive, comprehensive, and innovative. Such collections, exhibits, materials, and programming should present the diverse range of experiences and viewpoints of all women in the United States, reflecting upon the things that set women apart from one another while also highlighting the experiences that many of these women share.</content>
