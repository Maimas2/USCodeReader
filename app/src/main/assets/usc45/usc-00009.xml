<content> For the purposes of paragraph (iv) of subdivision (1), the Board, with the cooperation of employers and employees, shall secure the establishment of standards determining the physical and mental conditions which permanently disqualify employees for work in the several occupations in the railroad industry, and the Board, employers, and employees shall cooperate in the promotion of the greatest practicable degree of uniformity in the standards applied by the several employers. An individual’s condition shall be deemed to be disabling for work in his regular occupation if he will have been disqualified by his employer for service in his regular occupation in accordance with the applicable standards so established; if the employee will not have been so disqualified by his employer, the Board shall determine whether his condition is disabling for work in his regular occupation in accordance with the standards generally established; and, if the employee’s regular occupation is not one with respect to which standards will have been established, the standards relating to a reasonably comparable occupation shall be used. If there is no such comparable occupation, the Board shall determine whether the employee’s condition is disabling for work in his regular occupation by determining whether under the practices generally prevailing in industries in which such occupation exists such condition is a permanent disqualification for work in such occupation. For purposes of this subdivision and paragraph (iv) of subdivision (1), an employee’s “regular occupation” shall be deemed to be the occupation in which he will have been engaged in more calendar months than the calendar months in which he will have been engaged in any other occupation during the last preceding five calendar years, whether or not consecutive, in each of which years he will have earned wages or salary, except that, if an employee establishes that during the last fifteen consecutive calendar years he will have been engaged in another occupation in one-half or more of all the months in which he will have earned wages or salary, he may claim such other occupation as his regular occupation.</content>

If the individual fails to comply with the requirements prescribed by the Board as to proof of the continuance of the disability until he attains retirement age (as defined in section 216(<i>l</i>) of the Social Security Act), his right to an annuity by reason of such disability shall, except for good cause shown to the Board, cease, but without prejudice to his rights to any subsequent annuity to which he may be entitled.</content>

Any such individual under the retirement age (as defined in section 216(<i>l</i>) of the Social Security Act) shall report to the Board any such payment of earnings for such employment or self-employment before receipt and acceptance of an annuity for the second month following the month of such payment. A deduction shall be imposed, with respect to any such individual who fails to make such report, in the annuity or annuities otherwise due the individual, in an amount equal to the amount of the annuity for each month in which he is paid such earnings in such employment or self-employment, except that the first deduction imposed pursuant to this sentence shall in no case exceed an amount equal to the amount of the annuity otherwise due for the first month with respect to which the deduction is imposed. If pursuant to the first sentence of this subdivision an annuity was not paid to an individual with respect to one or more months in any calendar year, and it is subsequently established that the total amount of such individual’s earnings during such year as determined in accordance with that sentence (but exclusive of earnings for services described in subdivision (3)) did not exceed the amount of earnings computed by totaling the monthly allowable earnings as determined under this section for each month in the year (after deduction of disability related work expenses), the annuity with respect to such month or months, and any deduction imposed by reason of the failure to report earnings for such month or months under the third sentence of this subdivision, shall then be payable. If the total amount of such individual’s earnings during such year (exclusive of earnings for services as described in subdivision (3) and after deduction of disability related work expenses) is in excess of the annual allowable earnings amount, the number of months in such year with respect to which an annuity is not payable by reason of the first and third sentences shall not exceed the number of months derived by dividing the amount by which such annual earnings exceed the annual allowable earnings amount by the monthly allowable earning amount determined under this section. If the computation under the preceding sentence results in a remainder greater than or equal to one-half, the number of months for which an annuity is not payable as determined under the preceding sentence shall be increased by one. The annual allowable earnings amount shall be computed by totaling the amount of monthly allowable earnings as determined under the first sentence of this subdivision for each month in the calender <ref class="footnoteRef" idref="fn002009">6</ref> year. If the amount of the individual’s annuity has changed during the calendar year, any payment of annuities which become payable solely by reason of the limitations in the preceding three sentences shall be made first with respect to the month or months for which the annuity is larger. For purposes of this subdivision, “the monthly allowable earnings” shall be $700, except that for each year after 2007, “the monthly allowable earnings” amount shall be the larger of the amount for the previous year or the amount calculated by multiplying $700 by the ratio of the national average wage index for the year 2 calender <ref class="footnoteRef" idref="fn002009">6</ref> years before the year for which the amount is being calculated to the national average wage index for the year 2005. The amount so computed will be rounded to the next higher multiple of $10 where such amount is a multiple of $5 but not of $10 and to the nearest multiple of $10 in any other case.</content>

Such determination with respect to each such Trust Fund shall be made no later than June 15 following the close of the fiscal year. If, pursuant to any such determination, any amount is to be added to any such Trust Fund, the Board shall, within ten days after the determination, certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to such Trust Fund. If, pursuant to any such determination, any amount is to be subtracted from any such Trust Fund, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, within ten days after the determination, certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from such Trust Fund to the Railroad Retirement Account. Any amounts so certified shall further include interest (at the rate determined in subdivision (3) for the fiscal year under consideration) payable from the close of such fiscal year until the date of certification. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, or the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund or to any such Trust Fund from the Railroad Retirement Account, as the case may be, such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board and the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision and certified by the Board or the Secretary of Health and Human Services for transfer from any such Trust Fund or from the Railroad Retirement Account.</content>

If for any month the net amount so determined would be subtracted from those Trust Funds, the Board shall, within ten days after the end of such month, report such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the general fund to the Railroad Retirement Account. Any amount so reported shall further include interest (at an annual rate equal to the rate of interest borne by a special obligation issued to the Railroad Retirement Account in the month in which the transfer is made to the Account) payable from the close of the month for which the transfer is made until the date of transfer. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the general fund such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision and reported by the Board for transfer. For such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued after <date date="1983-08-12">August 12, 1983</date>, under <ref>section 3102 of title 31</ref>, and the purpose for which securities may be issued under <ref>section 3102 of title 31</ref> are extended to include such purpose. Each such transfer shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury within five days after a report of the amount to be transferred is received. Not later than December 31 following the close of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending <date date="1984-09-30">September 30, 1984</date>, the Board shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the total of all amounts transferred pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision for months in such fiscal year. Within ten days after a transfer, or transfers, pursuant to subdivision (2) for a particular fiscal year, the Board shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the general fund an amount equal to (A) the total of all amounts, exclusive of interest, transferred to such Account pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision for months in such fiscal year, plus (B) interest (at the rate determined in subdivision (3) for such fiscal year) payable with respect to each amount transferred for a month during such fiscal year from the close of the month for which the transfer of the amount was made until the date of retransfer of such amount. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the general fund such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the preceding sentence of this subdivision and reported by the Board for retransfer.</content>

<p class="indent0">In addition to the amount appropriated in subsection (a) of this section, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Railroad Retirement Account for each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending <date date="1975-06-30">June 30, 1975</date>, such amount as the Board determines to be necessary to meet (A) the additional costs, resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter, of benefits payable under <ref>section 231a of this title</ref>, but only to the extent that such Account is not reimbursed for such costs under <ref>section 231f(c)(2) of this title</ref>, (B) the additional administrative expenses resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter, and (C) any loss in interest to such Account resulting from the payment of additional benefits based on military service credited under this subchapter: <i>Provided, however</i>, That, in determining the amount to be appropriated to the Railroad Retirement Account for any fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, there shall not be considered any costs resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter for which appropriations to such Account have already been made pursuant to section 4(<i>l</i>) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [<ref>45 U.S.C. 228c–1</ref>(<i>l</i>)]. Any determination as to loss in interest to the Railroad Retirement Account pursuant to clause (C) of the first sentence of this subsection shall take into account interest from the date each annuity based, in part, on military service began to accrue or was increased to the date or dates on which the amount appropriated is credited to the Account. The cost resulting from the payment of additional benefits under this subchapter based on military service determined pursuant to the preceding provisions of this subsection shall be adjusted by applying thereto the ratio of the total net level cost of all benefits under this subchapter to the portion of such net level cost remaining after the exclusion of administrative expenses and interest charges on the unfunded accrued liability as determined under the last completed actuarial valuation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section. At the close of the fiscal year ending <date date="1975-06-30">June 30, 1975</date>, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Board shall, as promptly as practicable, determine the amount to be appropriated to the Account pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, and shall certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the general fund in the Treasury to the Railroad Retirement Account. When authorized by an appropriation Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the general fund in the Treasury such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and certified by the Board for transfer to such Account. In any determination made pursuant to <ref>section 231f(c)(2) of this title</ref>, no further charges shall be made against the Trust Funds established by title II of the Social Security Act [<ref>42 U.S.C. 401</ref> et seq.] for military service rendered before <date date="1957-01-01">January 1, 1957</date>, and with respect to which appropriations authorized by clause (2) of the first sentence of section 4(<i>l</i>) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 shall have been credited to the Railroad Retirement Account, but the additional benefit payments incurred by such Trust Funds by reason of such military service shall be taken in account in making any such determination.</p>

For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (A) on original issue at the issue price; or (B) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the accounts. Such obligations issued for purchase by the accounts shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the accounts, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing notes of the United States then forming a part of the public debt that are not due or callable until after the expiration of three years from the end of such calendar month, except that where such rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest on such obligation shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such rate: <i>Provided</i>, That the rate of interest on such obligations shall in no case be less than 3 per centum per annum.

All requests of the Board to the Secretary, provided for in this subsection, shall be mandatory upon the Secretary. It shall be the duty of the Board to determine at all times what proportion of the accounts shall be invested in other than special obligations issued to the accounts and further to determine which of such obligations available to the accounts consistent with the requirements of this subsection will provide the greatest rate of return on the funds invested.</p>
