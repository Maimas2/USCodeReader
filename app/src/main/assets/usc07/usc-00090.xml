<heading class="bold"> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">Congress makes the following findings:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> Honey is produced by many individual producers in every State in the United States.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Honey and honey products move in large part in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce, and honey which does not move in such channels directly burdens or affects interstate commerce.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> In recent years, large quantities of low-cost, imported honey have been brought into the United States, replacing domestic honey in the normal trade channels.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> The maintenance and expansion of existing honey markets and the development of new or improved markets or uses are vital to the welfare of honey producers and those concerned with marketing, using, and processing honey, along with those engaged in general agricultural endeavors requiring bees for pollinating purposes.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> The honey production industry within the United States is comprised mainly of small- and medium-sized businesses.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> The development and implementation of coordinated programs of research, promotion, consumer education, and industry information necessary for the maintenance of markets and the development of new markets have been inadequate.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> Without cooperative action in providing for and financing such programs, honey producers, honey handlers, wholesalers, and retailers are unable to implement programs of research, promotion, consumer education, and industry information necessary to maintain and improve markets for these products.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<content> The ability to develop and maintain purity standards for honey and honey products is critical to maintaining the consumer confidence, safety, and trust that are essential components of any undertaking to maintain and develop markets for honey and honey products.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(9)</num>
<content> Research directed at improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of beekeeping, as well as developing better means of dealing with pest and disease problems, is essential to keeping honey and honey product prices competitive and facilitating market growth as well as maintaining the financial well-being of the honey industry.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(10)</num>
<content> Research involving the quality, safety, and image of honey and honey products and how that quality, safety, and image may be affected during the extraction, processing, packaging, marketing, and other stages of the honey and honey product production and distribution process, is highly important to building and maintaining markets for honey and honey products.</content>
