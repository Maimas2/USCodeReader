<p class="indent0">Whenever the President or other member of the executive branch of Government causes the export of any agricultural commodity to any country or area of the world to be suspended or restricted for reasons of national security or foreign policy under the Export Administration Act of 1979 or any other provision of law and the Secretary of Agriculture determines that such suspension or restriction will result in a surplus supply of such commodity that will adversely affect prices producers receive for the commodity, the Secretary may establish a gasohol feedstock reserve or a food security reserve, or both, of the commodity, as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if the commodity is suitable for stockpiling in a reserve.</p>
