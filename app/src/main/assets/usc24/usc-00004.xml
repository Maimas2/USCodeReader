<heading> Findings and purposes</heading>
<subsection class="indent0">
<num>(a)</num>
<chapeau> The Congress makes the following findings:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> Governmentally administered mental health services in the District of Columbia are currently provided through two separate public entities, the federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital and the Mental Health Services Administration of the District of Columbia Department of Human Resources.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> The District of Columbia has a continuing responsibility to provide mental health services to its residents.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> The Federal Government, through its operation of a national mental health program at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, has for over 100 years assisted the District of Columbia in carrying out that responsibility.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<chapeau> Since its establishment by Congress in 1855, Saint Elizabeths Hospital has developed into a respected national mental health hospital and study, training, and treatment center, providing a range of quality mental health and related services, including—</chapeau>
<clause class="indent2">
<num>(i)</num>
<content> acute and chronic inpatient psychiatric care;</content>

</clause>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">

</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">

<content> The assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital from the Federal Government by the District of Columbia, and the integration of those functions, resources, and programs into a comprehensive mental health care system administered solely by the District of Columbia, will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the services currently provided through those two separate entities by shifting the primary focus of care to an integrated community-based system.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> Such assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital by the District of Columbia would further the principle of home rule for the District of Columbia.</content>
