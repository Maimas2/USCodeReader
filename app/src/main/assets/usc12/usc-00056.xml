<heading class="bold"> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">The Congress finds as follows:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<chapeau> The Secretary of the Treasury has long compensated financial institutions for various critical depositary and financial agency services provided for or on behalf of the United States by—</chapeau>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(A)</num>
<content> placing large balances, commonly referred to as “compensating balances”, on deposit at such institutions; and</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(B)</num>
<content> using imputed interest on such funds to offset charges for the various depositary and financial agency services provided to or on behalf of the Government.</content>
</subparagraph>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> As a result of sharp declines in interest rates over the last few years to record low levels, or the public debt outstanding reaching the statutory debt limit, the Department of the Treasury often has had to dramatically increase or decrease the size of the compensating balances on deposit at these financial institutions.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> The fluctuation of the compensating balances, and the necessary pledging of collateral by financial institutions to secure the value of compensating balances placed with those institutions, have created unintended financial uncertainty for the Secretary of the Treasury and for the management by financial institutions of their cash and securities.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> It is imperative that the process for providing financial services to the Government be transparent, and provide the information necessary for the Congress to effectively exercise its appropriation and oversight responsibilities.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> The use of direct payment for services rendered would strengthen cash and debt management responsibilities of the Secretary of the Treasury because the Secretary would no longer need to dramatically increase or decrease the level of such balances when interest rates fluctuate sharply or when the public debt outstanding reaches the statutory debt limit.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> An alternative to the use of compensating balances, such as direct payments to financial institutions, would ensure that payments to financial institutions for the services they provide would be made in a more predictable manner and could result in cost savings.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> Limiting the use of compensating balances could result in a more direct and cost-efficient method of obtaining those services currently provided under compensating balance arrangements.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<content> A transition from the use of compensating balances to another compensation method must be carefully managed to prevent higher-than-necessary transitional costs and enable participating financial institutions to modify their planned investment of cash and securities.</content>
