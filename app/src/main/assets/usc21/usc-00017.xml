</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Drug abuse seriously impairs individual, as well as societal, health and well-being.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> Drug abuse, especially heroin addiction, substantially contributes to crime.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> The adverse impact of drug abuse inflicts increasing pain and hardship on individuals, families, and communities and undermines our institutions.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> Too little is known about drug abuse, especially the causes, and ways to treat and prevent drug abuse.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> The success of Federal drug abuse programs and activities requires a recognition that education, treatment, rehabilitation, research, training, and law enforcement efforts are interrelated.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> The effectiveness of efforts by State and local governments and by the Federal Government to control and treat drug abuse in the United States has been hampered by a lack of coordination among the States, between States and localities, among the Federal Government, States and localities, and throughout the Federal establishment.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<content> Control of drug abuse requires the development of a comprehensive, coordinated long-term Federal strategy that encompasses both effective law enforcement against illegal drug traffic and effective health programs to rehabilitate victims of drug abuse.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(9)</num>
<content> The increasing rate of drug abuse constitutes a serious and continuing threat to national health and welfare, requiring an immediate and effective response on the part of the Federal Government.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(10)</num>
<content> Although the Congress observed a significant apparent reduction in the rate of increase of drug abuse during the three-year period subsequent to <date date="1972-03-21">March 21, 1972</date>, and in certain areas of the country apparent temporary reductions in its incidence, the increase and spread of heroin consumption since 1974, and the continuing abuse of other dangerous drugs, clearly indicate the need for effective, ongoing, and highly visible Federal leadership in the formation and execution of a comprehensive, coordinated drug abuse policy.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(11)</num>
<content> Shifts in the usage of various drugs and in the Nation’s demographic composition require a Federal strategy to adjust the focus of drug abuse programs to meet new needs and priorities on a cost-effective basis.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(12)</num>
<content> The growing extent of drug abuse indicates an urgent need for prevention and intervention programs designed to reach the general population and members of high risk populations such as youth, women, and the elderly.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(13)</num>
<content> Effective control of drug abuse requires high-level coordination of Federal international and domestic activities relating to both supply of, and demand for, commonly abused drugs.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(14)</num>
<content> Local governments with high concentrations of drug abuse should be actively involved in the planning and coordination of efforts to combat drug abuse.</content>
