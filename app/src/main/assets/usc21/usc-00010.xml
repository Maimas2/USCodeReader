After entry of the decree and upon the payment of the costs of such proceedings and the execution of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that such article shall not be sold or disposed of contrary to the provisions of this chapter or the laws of any State or Territory in which sold, the court may by order direct that such article be delivered to the owner thereof to be destroyed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter, under the supervision of an officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary, and the expenses of such supervision shall be paid by the person obtaining release of the article under bond. If the article was imported into the United States and the person seeking its release establishes (A) that the adulteration, misbranding, or violation did not occur after the article was imported, and (B) that he had no cause for believing that it was adulterated, misbranded, or in violation before it was released from customs custody, the court may permit the article to be delivered to the owner for exportation in lieu of destruction upon a showing by the owner that all of the conditions of <ref>section 381(e) of this title</ref> can and will be met.

In establishing such tolerance, the Secretary shall rely on data sufficient to demonstrate that a proposed tolerance is safe based on similar food safety criteria used by the Secretary to establish tolerances for applications for new animal drugs filed under subsection (b)(1). The Secretary may consider and rely on data submitted by the drug manufacturer, including data submitted to appropriate regulatory authorities in any country where the new animal drug is lawfully used or data available from a relevant international organization, to the extent such data are not inconsistent with the criteria used by the Secretary to establish a tolerance for applications for new animal drugs filed under subsection (b)(1). For purposes of this paragraph, “relevant international organization” means the Codex Alimenterius <ref class="footnoteRef" idref="fn002062">2</ref> Commission or other international organization deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary may, under procedures specified by regulation, revoke a tolerance established under this paragraph if information demonstrates that the use of the new animal drug under actual use conditions results in food being imported into the United States with residues exceeding the tolerance or if scientific evidence shows the tolerance to be unsafe.</content>

<p class="indent0">The Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon his request, samples of food, drugs, devices, tobacco products, and cosmetics which are being imported or offered for import into the United States, giving notice thereof to the owner or consignee, who may appear before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and have the right to introduce testimony. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish to the Secretary of the Treasury a list of establishments registered pursuant to subsection (i) of section 360 or <ref>section 387e(h) of this title</ref> and shall request that if any drugs, devices, or tobacco products manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not so registered are imported or offered for import into the United States, samples of such drugs, devices, or tobacco products be delivered to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with notice of such delivery to the owner or consignee, who may appear before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and have the right to introduce testimony. If it appears from the examination of such samples or otherwise that (1) such article has been manufactured, processed, or packed under insanitary conditions or, in the case of a device, the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, packing, storage, or installation of the device do not conform to the requirements of <ref>section 360j(f) of this title</ref>, or (2) such article is forbidden or restricted in sale in the country in which it was produced or from which it was exported, or (3) such article is adulterated, misbranded, or in violation of <ref>section 355 of this title</ref> or the importer (as defined in <ref>section 384a of this title</ref>) is in violation of such <ref>section 384a of this title</ref>, or prohibited from introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce under section 331(<i>ll</i>) of this title, or is a controlled substance subject to an order under <ref>section 360bbb–8d of this title</ref>, or (4) the recordkeeping requirements under <ref>section 2223 of this title</ref> (other than the requirements under subsection (f) of such section) have not been complied with regarding such article or <ref class="footnoteRef" idref="fn002114">1</ref> (5) such article is being imported or offered for import in violation of <ref>section 331(cc) of this title</ref>, then any such article described in any of clauses (1) through (5) shall be refused admission, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. If it appears from the examination of such samples or otherwise that the article is a counterfeit drug or counterfeit device, such article shall be refused admission. With respect to an article of food, if importation of such food is subject to, but not compliant with, the requirement under subsection (q) that such food be accompanied by a certification or other assurance that the food meets applicable requirements of this chapter, then such article shall be refused admission. If such article is subject to a requirement under section 364a, 379aa, or 379aa–1 of this title and if the Secretary has credible evidence or information indicating that the responsible person (as defined in section 364, 379aa, or 379aa–1 of this title) has not complied with a requirement of such section 364a, 379aa, or 379aa–1 of this title with respect to any such article, or has not allowed access to records described in such section 364a, 379aa, or 379aa–1 of this title, then such article shall be refused admission, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary of the Treasury shall cause the destruction of any such article refused admission unless such article is exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, within 90 days of the date of notice of such refusal or within such additional time as may be permitted pursuant to such regulations, except that the Secretary of Health and Human Services may destroy, without the opportunity for export, any drug or device refused admission under this section, if such drug or device is valued at an amount that is $2,500 or less (or such higher amount as the Secretary of the Treasury may set by regulation pursuant to <ref>section 1498(a)(1) of title 19</ref>) and was not brought into compliance as described under subsection (b). The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue regulations providing for notice and an opportunity to appear before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and introduce testimony, as described in the first sentence of this subsection, on destruction of a drug or device under the seventh sentence of this subsection. The regulations shall provide that prior to destruction, appropriate due process is available to the owner or consignee seeking to challenge the decision to destroy the drug or device. Where the Secretary of Health and Human Services provides notice and an opportunity to appear and introduce testimony on the destruction of a drug or device, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall store and, as applicable, dispose of the drug or device after the issuance of the notice, except that the owner and consignee shall remain liable for costs pursuant to subsection (c). Such process may be combined with the notice and opportunity to appear before the Secretary and introduce testimony, as described in the first sentence of this subsection, as long as appropriate notice is provided to the owner or consignee. Neither clause (2) nor clause (5) of the third sentence of this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the admission of narcotic drugs, the importation of which is permitted under the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act [<ref>21 U.S.C. 951</ref> et seq.].</p>
