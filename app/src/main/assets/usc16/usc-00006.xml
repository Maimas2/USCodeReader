<p class="indent0">It is recognized that research in forestry is the driving force behind progress in developing and utilizing the resources of the Nation’s forest and related rangelands. The production, protection, and utilization of the forest resources depend on strong technological advances and continuing development of the knowledge necessary to increase the efficiency of forestry practices and to extend the benefits that flow from forest and related rangelands. It is recognized that the total forestry research efforts of the several State colleges and universities and of the Federal Government are more fully effective if there is close coordination between such programs, and it is further recognized that forestry schools are especially vital in the training of research workers in forestry. It is also recognized that the provisions of this subchapter are essential to assist in providing the research background that undergirds the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 [<ref>16 U.S.C. 1600</ref> et seq.], the Renewable Resources Extension Act of 1978,<ref class="footnoteRef" idref="fn002456">1</ref> and the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977 [<ref>16 U.S.C. 2001</ref> et seq.].</p>

If more than one institution within a State are certified as qualifying for assistance, then it shall be the responsibility of such institutions, in agreement with the Secretary, to develop complementary programs of forestry research for the State.</p>

The Secretary is authorized to make such expenditures on the certificate of the appropriate official of the college or university having charge of the forestry research for which the expenditures as herein provided are to be made. If any or all of the colleges or universities certified for receipt of funds under this subchapter fails to make available and budget for expenditure for forestry research in any fiscal year sums at least as much as the amount for which it would be eligible for such year under this subchapter, the difference between the Federal funds available and the funds made available and budgeted for expenditure by the college or university shall be reapportioned by the Secretary to other eligible colleges or universities of the same State if there be any which qualify therefor and, if there be none, the Secretary shall reapportion such differences to the qualifying colleges and universities of other States participating in the forestry research program. If in any year the amount made available by a State from its own funds (including any revenue-sharing funds) to a State-certified institution eligible for assistance under this subchapter is reduced because of an increase in the allotment made available under this subchapter, the allotment of such State-certified institution from the next succeeding appropriation shall be reduced in an equivalent amount. The Secretary shall reapportion the amount of such reduction to other eligible colleges and universities of the same State if there be any that qualify therefor and, if there be none, the Secretary shall reapportion such amount to the qualifying colleges and universities of other States participating in the forestry research program.</p>

When thus recorded, the agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, successors, and assigns of the owner of such land, and upon purchasers of timber or other forest products from such land, throughout the life of such cooperative agreement.</p>
