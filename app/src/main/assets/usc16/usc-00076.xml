<heading class="bold"> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">The Congress finds and declares the following:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> The fish off the coasts of the United States, the highly migratory species of the high seas, the species which dwell on or in the Continental Shelf appertaining to the United States, and the anadromous species which spawn in United States rivers or estuaries, constitute valuable and renewable natural resources. These fishery resources contribute to the food supply, economy, and health of the Nation and provide recreational opportunities.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Certain stocks of fish have declined to the point where their survival is threatened, and other stocks of fish have been so substantially reduced in number that they could become similarly threatened as a consequence of (A) increased fishing pressure, (B) the inadequacy of fishery resource conservation and management practices and controls, or (C) direct and indirect habitat losses which have resulted in a diminished capacity to support existing fishing levels.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> Commercial and recreational fishing constitutes a major source of employment and contributes significantly to the economy of the Nation. Many coastal areas are dependent upon fishing and related activities, and their economies have been badly damaged by the overfishing of fishery resources at an ever-increasing rate over the past decade. The activities of massive foreign fishing fleets in waters adjacent to such coastal areas have contributed to such damage, interfered with domestic fishing efforts, and caused destruction of the fishing gear of United States fishermen.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> International fishery agreements have not been effective in preventing or terminating the overfishing of these valuable fishery resources. There is danger that irreversible effects from overfishing will take place before an effective international agreement on fishery management jurisdiction can be negotiated, signed, ratified, and implemented.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> Fishery resources are finite but renewable. If placed under sound management before overfishing has caused irreversible effects, the fisheries can be conserved and maintained so as to provide optimum yields on a continuing basis.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> A national program for the conservation and management of the fishery resources of the United States is necessary to prevent overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, to insure conservation, to facilitate long-term protection of essential fish habitats, and to realize the full potential of the Nation’s fishery resources.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> A national program for the development of fisheries which are underutilized or not utilized by the United States fishing industry, including bottom fish off Alaska, is necessary to assure that our citizens benefit from the employment, food supply, and revenue which could be generated thereby.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<content> The collection of reliable data is essential to the effective conservation, management, and scientific understanding of the fishery resources of the United States.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(9)</num>
<content> One of the greatest long-term threats to the viability of commercial and recreational fisheries is the continuing loss of marine, estuarine, and other aquatic habitats. Habitat considerations should receive increased attention for the conservation and management of fishery resources of the United States.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(10)</num>
<content> Pacific Insular Areas contain unique historical, cultural, legal, political, and geographical circumstances which make fisheries resources important in sustaining their economic growth.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(11)</num>
<content> A number of the Fishery Management Councils have demonstrated significant progress in integrating ecosystem considerations in fisheries management using the existing authorities provided under this chapter.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(12)</num>
<content> International cooperation is necessary to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and other fishing practices which may harm the sustainability of living marine resources and disadvantage the United States fishing industry.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(13)</num>
<content> While both provide significant cultural and economic benefits to the Nation, recreational fishing and commercial fishing are different activities. Therefore, science-based conservation and management approaches should be adapted to the characteristics of each sector.</content>
