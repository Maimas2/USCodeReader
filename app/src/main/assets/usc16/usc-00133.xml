<heading class="bold"> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">The Congress finds that—</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> marine turtle populations have declined to the point that the long-term survival of the loggerhead, green, hawksbill, Kemp’s ridley, olive ridley, and leatherback turtle in the wild is in serious jeopardy;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> 6 of the 7 recognized species of marine turtles are listed as threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (<ref>16 U.S.C. 1531</ref> et seq.), and all 7 species have been included in Appendix I of CITES;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> because marine turtles are long-lived, late-maturing, and highly migratory, marine turtles are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of human exploitation and habitat loss;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> illegal international trade seriously threatens wild populations of some marine turtle species, particularly the hawksbill turtle;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> the challenges facing marine turtles are immense, and the resources available have not been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of nesting habitats caused by human activities and the consequent diminution of marine turtle populations;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> because marine turtles are flagship species for the ecosystems in which marine turtles are found, sustaining healthy populations of marine turtles provides benefits to many other species of wildlife, including many other threatened or endangered species;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> marine turtles are important components of the ecosystems that they inhabit, and studies of wild populations of marine turtles have provided important biological insights;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<content> changes in marine turtle populations are most reliably indicated by changes in the numbers of nests and nesting females; and</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(9)</num>
<chapeau> the reduction, removal, or other effective addressing of the threats to the long-term viability of populations of marine turtles will require the joint commitment and effort of—</chapeau>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(A)</num>
<content> countries that have within their boundaries marine turtle nesting habitats; and</content>
