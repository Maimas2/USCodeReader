<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> the Antarctic continent with its associated and dependent ecosystems is a distinctive environment providing a habitat for many unique species and offering a natural laboratory from which to monitor critical aspects of stratospheric ozone depletion and global climate change;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Antarctica is protected by a series of international agreements, including the Antarctic Treaty and associated recommendations, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which are intended to conserve the renewable natural resources of Antarctica and to recognize the importance of Antarctica for the conduct of scientific research;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> recurring and recent developments in Antarctica, including increased siting of scientific stations, poor waste disposal practices, oil spills, increased tourism, and the over-exploitation of marine living resources, have raised serious questions about the adequacy and implementation of existing agreements and domestic law to protect the Antarctic environment and its living marine resources;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> the parties to the Antarctic Treaty have negotiated a Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities which the United States has signed but not yet ratified;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities does not guarantee the preservation of the fragile environment of Antarctica and could actually stimulate movement toward Antarctic mineral resource activity;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> the exploitation of mineral resources in Antarctica could lead to additional degradation of the Antarctic environment, including increased risk of oil spills;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have agreed to a voluntary ban on Antarctic mineral resource activities which needs to be made legally binding;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<content> the level of scientific study, including necessary support facilities, has increased to the point that some scientific programs may be degrading the Antarctic environment; and</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(9)</num>
<content> the planned special consultative meeting of parties to the Antarctic Treaty and the imminence of the thirtieth anniversary of the Antarctic Treaty provide opportunities for the United States to exercise leadership toward protection and sound management of Antarctica.</content>
