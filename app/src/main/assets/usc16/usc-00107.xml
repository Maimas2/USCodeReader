<heading> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">The Congress finds the following:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> Asian elephant populations in nations within the range of Asian elephants have continued to decline to the point that the long-term survival of the species in the wild is in serious jeopardy.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> The Asian elephant is listed as an endangered species under <ref>section 1533 of this title</ref> and under appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> Because the challenges facing the conservation of Asian elephants are so great, resources to date have not been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of habitat and the consequent diminution of Asian elephant populations.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> The Asian elephant is a flagship species for the conservation of tropical forest habitats in which it is found and provides the consequent benefit from such conservation to numerous other species of wildlife including many other endangered species.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> Among the threats to the Asian elephant in addition to habitat loss are population fragmentation, human-elephant conflict, poaching for ivory, meat, hide, bones and teeth, and capture for domestication.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> To reduce, remove, or otherwise effectively address these threats to the long-term viability of populations of Asian elephants in the wild will require the joint commitment and effort of nations within the range of Asian elephants, the United States and other countries, and the private sector.</content>
