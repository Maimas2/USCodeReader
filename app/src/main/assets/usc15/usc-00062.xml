<heading class="bold"> Informed use of credit</heading>
<content>
<p class="indent0">The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.</p>

<content>
<p class="indent0">The Congress also finds that there has been a recent trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that these leases have been offered without adequate cost disclosures. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of the terms of leases of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms available to him, limit balloon payments in consumer leasing, enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms where appropriate, and to assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements.</p>

The creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, to any obligor in a transaction subject to this section the rights of the obligor under this section.

If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it. Upon the performance of the creditor’s obligations under this section, the obligor shall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the obligor shall tender its reasonable value. Tender shall be made at the location of the property or at the residence of the obligor, at the option of the obligor. If the creditor does not take possession of the property within 20 days after tender by the obligor, ownership of the property vests in the obligor without obligation on his part to pay for it.

<p class="indent0">Where the lessee’s liability on expiration of a consumer lease is based on the estimated residual value of the property such estimated residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, where the lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor’s estimated residual value is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on expiration of a consumer lease unless the lessor brings a successful action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor shall pay the lessee’s reasonable attorney’s fees. The presumptions stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of estimated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjustment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an agreement is reached after termination of the lease.</p>

<chapeau class="indent0">The Congress finds:</chapeau>

<p class="indent0">Any credit repair organization shall provide any consumer with the following written statement before any contract or agreement between the consumer and the credit repair organization is executed:</p>
<p class="centered">
<b>“Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law</b>
</p>
<p class="indent0">“You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, neither you nor any ‘credit repair’ company or credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report. The credit bureau must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.</p>
<p class="indent0">“You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud.</p>
<p class="indent0">“You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.</p>
<p class="indent0">“You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it.</p>
<p class="indent0">“Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may occur.</p>
<p class="indent0">“You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.</p>
<p class="indent0">“If the credit bureau’s reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues about you.</p>
<p class="indent0">“The Federal Trade Commission regulates credit bureaus and credit repair organizations. For more information contact:</p>
<p class="centered">“The Public Reference Branch</p>
<p class="centered">“Federal Trade Commission</p>
<p class="centered">“Washington, D.C. 20580”.</p>
<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(b) Separate statement requirement</p>
<p class="indent0">The written statement required under this section shall be provided as a document which is separate from any written contract or other agreement between the credit repair organization and the consumer or any other written material provided to the consumer.</p>
<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(c) Retention of compliance records</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(1) In general</p>
<p class="indent1">The credit repair organization shall maintain a copy of the statement signed by the consumer acknowledging receipt of the statement.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(2) Maintenance for 2 years</p>
<p class="indent1">The copy of any consumer’s statement shall be maintained in the organization’s files for 2 years after the date on which the statement is signed by the consumer.</p>

<p class="indent1">Upon the direct request of a consumer, or an individual acting on behalf of or as a personal representative of a consumer, who asserts in good faith a suspicion that the consumer has been or is about to become a victim of fraud or related crime, including identity theft, a consumer reporting agency described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref> that maintains a file on the consumer and has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester shall—</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) include a fraud alert in the file of that consumer, and also provide that alert along with any credit score generated in using that file, for a period of not less than 1 year, beginning on the date of such request, unless the consumer or such representative requests that such fraud alert be removed before the end of such period, and the agency has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester for such purpose; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) refer the information regarding the fraud alert under this paragraph to each of the other consumer reporting agencies described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref>, in accordance with procedures developed under <ref>section 1681s(f) of this title</ref>.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(2) Access to free reports</p>
<p class="indent1">In any case in which a consumer reporting agency includes a fraud alert in the file of a consumer pursuant to this subsection, the consumer reporting agency shall—</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) disclose to the consumer that the consumer may request a free copy of the file of the consumer pursuant to <ref>section 1681j(d) of this title</ref>; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) provide to the consumer all disclosures required to be made under <ref>section 1681g of this title</ref>, without charge to the consumer, not later than 3 business days after any request described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(b) Extended alerts</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(1) In general</p>
<p class="indent1">Upon the direct request of a consumer, or an individual acting on behalf of or as a personal representative of a consumer, who submits an identity theft report to a consumer reporting agency described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref> that maintains a file on the consumer, if the agency has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester, the agency shall—</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) include a fraud alert in the file of that consumer, and also provide that alert along with any credit score generated in using that file, during the 7-year period beginning on the date of such request, unless the consumer or such representative requests that such fraud alert be removed before the end of such period and the agency has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester for such purpose;</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) during the 5-year period beginning on the date of such request, exclude the consumer from any list of consumers prepared by the consumer reporting agency and provided to any third party to offer credit or insurance to the consumer as part of a transaction that was not initiated by the consumer, unless the consumer or such representative requests that such exclusion be rescinded before the end of such period; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(C) refer the information regarding the extended fraud alert under this paragraph to each of the other consumer reporting agencies described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref>, in accordance with procedures developed under <ref>section 1681s(f) of this title</ref>.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(2) Access to free reports</p>

<p class="indent2">(A) disclose to the consumer that the consumer may request 2 free copies of the file of the consumer pursuant to <ref>section 1681j(d) of this title</ref> during the 12-month period beginning on the date on which the fraud alert was included in the file; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) provide to the consumer all disclosures required to be made under <ref>section 1681g of this title</ref>, without charge to the consumer, not later than 3 business days after any request described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(c) Active duty alerts</p>
<p class="indent0">Upon the direct request of an active duty military consumer, or an individual acting on behalf of or as a personal representative of an active duty military consumer, a consumer reporting agency described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref> that maintains a file on the active duty military consumer and has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester shall—</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) include an active duty alert in the file of that active duty military consumer, and also provide that alert along with any credit score generated in using that file, during a period of not less than 12 months, or such longer period as the Bureau shall determine, by regulation, beginning on the date of the request, unless the active duty military consumer or such representative requests that such fraud alert be removed before the end of such period, and the agency has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester for such purpose;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) during the 2-year period beginning on the date of such request, exclude the active duty military consumer from any list of consumers prepared by the consumer reporting agency and provided to any third party to offer credit or insurance to the consumer as part of a transaction that was not initiated by the consumer, unless the consumer requests that such exclusion be rescinded before the end of such period; and</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) refer the information regarding the active duty alert to each of the other consumer reporting agencies described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref>, in accordance with procedures developed under <ref>section 1681s(f) of this title</ref>.</p>
<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(d) Procedures</p>
<p class="indent0">Each consumer reporting agency described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref> shall establish policies and procedures to comply with this section, including procedures that inform consumers of the availability of initial, extended, and active duty alerts and procedures that allow consumers and active duty military consumers to request initial, extended, or active duty alerts (as applicable) in a simple and easy manner, including by telephone.</p>
<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(e) Referrals of alerts</p>
<p class="indent0">Each consumer reporting agency described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref> that receives a referral of a fraud alert or active duty alert from another consumer reporting agency pursuant to this section shall, as though the agency received the request from the consumer directly, follow the procedures required under—</p>

<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(g) Duty of other consumer reporting agencies to provide contact information</p>
<p class="indent0">If a consumer contacts any consumer reporting agency that is not described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref> to communicate a suspicion that the consumer has been or is about to become a victim of fraud or related crime, including identity theft, the agency shall provide information to the consumer on how to contact the Bureau and the consumer reporting agencies described in <ref>section 1681a(p) of this title</ref> to obtain more detailed information and request alerts under this section.</p>

<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(A) Notification</p>
<p class="indent2">Each initial fraud alert and active duty alert under this section shall include information that notifies all prospective users of a consumer report on the consumer to which the alert relates that the consumer does not authorize the establishment of any new credit plan or extension of credit, other than under an open-end credit plan (as defined in section 1602(i) <ref class="footnoteRef" idref="fn002370">1</ref> of this title), in the name of the consumer, or issuance of an additional card on an existing credit account requested by a consumer, or any increase in credit limit on an existing credit account requested by a consumer, except in accordance with subparagraph (B).</p>

<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(5) Notice of rights</p>
<p class="indent1">At any time a consumer is required to receive a summary of rights required under <ref>section 1681g of this title</ref>, the following notice shall be included:</p>
<p class="centered">
<inline class="small-caps">“Consumers Have the Right To Obtain a Security Freeze</inline>
</p>
<p class="indent0">“You have a right to place a ‘security freeze’ on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.</p>
<p class="indent0">“As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer’s credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer’s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer’s identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.</p>
<p class="indent0">“A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.”.</p>

<p class="indent2">(B) the records requested under this subsection do not exist or are not reasonably available.</p>

<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(f) Disclosure of credit scores</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(1) In general</p>
<p class="indent1">Upon the request of a consumer for a credit score, a consumer reporting agency shall supply to the consumer a statement indicating that the information and credit scoring model may be different than the credit score that may be used by the lender, and a notice which shall include—</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) the current credit score of the consumer or the most recent credit score of the consumer that was previously calculated by the credit reporting agency for a purpose related to the extension of credit;</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) the range of possible credit scores under the model used;</p>

<p class="indent2">(D) the date on which the credit score was created; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(E) the name of the person or entity that provided the credit score or credit file upon which the credit score was created.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(2) Definitions</p>
<p class="indent1">For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(A) Credit score</p>
<p class="indent2">The term “credit score”—</p>
<p class="indent3">(i) means a numerical value or a categorization derived from a statistical tool or modeling system used by a person who makes or arranges a loan to predict the likelihood of certain credit behaviors, including default (and the numerical value or the categorization derived from such analysis may also be referred to as a “risk predictor” or “risk score”); and</p>
<p class="indent3">(ii) does not include—</p>
<p class="indent4">(I) any mortgage score or rating of an automated underwriting system that considers one or more factors in addition to credit information, including the loan to value ratio, the amount of down payment, or the financial assets of a consumer; or</p>
<p class="indent4">(II) any other elements of the underwriting process or underwriting decision.</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(B) Key factors</p>
<p class="indent2">The term “key factors” means all relevant elements or reasons adversely affecting the credit score for the particular individual, listed in the order of their importance based on their effect on the credit score.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(3) Timeframe and manner of disclosure</p>
<p class="indent1">The information required by this subsection shall be provided in the same timeframe and manner as the information described in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(4) Applicability to certain uses</p>
<p class="indent1">This subsection shall not be construed so as to compel a consumer reporting agency to develop or disclose a score if the agency does not—</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) distribute scores that are used in connection with residential real property loans; or</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) develop scores that assist credit providers in understanding the general credit behavior of a consumer and predicting the future credit behavior of the consumer.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(5) Applicability to credit scores developed by another person</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(A) In general</p>
<p class="indent2">This subsection shall not be construed to require a consumer reporting agency that distributes credit scores developed by another person or entity to provide a further explanation of them, or to process a dispute arising pursuant to <ref>section 1681i of this title</ref>, except that the consumer reporting agency shall provide the consumer with the name and address and website for contacting the person or entity who developed the score or developed the methodology of the score.</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(B) Exception</p>
<p class="indent2">This paragraph shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency that develops or modifies scores that are developed by another person or entity.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(6) Maintenance of credit scores not required</p>
<p class="indent1">This subsection shall not be construed to require a consumer reporting agency to maintain credit scores in its files.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(7) Compliance in certain cases</p>
<p class="indent1">In complying with this subsection, a consumer reporting agency shall—</p>
<p class="indent2">(A) supply the consumer with a credit score that is derived from a credit scoring model that is widely distributed to users by that consumer reporting agency in connection with residential real property loans or with a credit score that assists the consumer in understanding the credit scoring assessment of the credit behavior of the consumer and predictions about the future credit behavior of the consumer; and</p>
<p class="indent2">(B) a statement indicating that the information and credit scoring model may be different than that used by the lender.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(8) Fair and reasonable fee</p>
<p class="indent1">A consumer reporting agency may charge a fair and reasonable fee, as determined by the Bureau, for providing the information required under this subsection.</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(9) Use of enquiries as a key factor</p>
<p class="indent1">If a key factor that adversely affects the credit score of a consumer consists of the number of enquiries made with respect to a consumer report, that factor shall be included in the disclosure pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) without regard to the numerical limitation in such paragraph.</p>
<p class="indent2 firstIndent-2">(g) Disclosure of credit scores by certain mortgage lenders</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(1) In general</p>
<p class="indent1">Any person who makes or arranges loans and who uses a consumer credit score, as defined in subsection (f), in connection with an application initiated or sought by a consumer for a closed end loan or the establishment of an open end loan for a consumer purpose that is secured by 1 to 4 units of residential real property (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the “lender”) shall provide the following to the consumer as soon as reasonably practicable:</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(A) Information required under subsection (f)</p>
<p class="indent5 firstIndent-2">(i) In general</p>
<p class="indent3">A copy of the information identified in subsection (f) that was obtained from a consumer reporting agency or was developed and used by the user of the information.</p>
<p class="indent5 firstIndent-2">(ii) Notice under subparagraph (D)</p>
<p class="indent3">In addition to the information provided to it by a third party that provided the credit score or scores, a lender is only required to provide the notice contained in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(B) Disclosures in case of automated underwriting system</p>
<p class="indent5 firstIndent-2">(i) In general</p>
<p class="indent3">If a person that is subject to this subsection uses an automated underwriting system to underwrite a loan, that person may satisfy the obligation to provide a credit score by disclosing a credit score and associated key factors supplied by a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p class="indent5 firstIndent-2">(ii) Numerical credit score</p>
<p class="indent3">However, if a numerical credit score is generated by an automated underwriting system used by an enterprise, and that score is disclosed to the person, the score shall be disclosed to the consumer consistent with subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="indent5 firstIndent-2">(iii) Enterprise defined</p>
<p class="indent3">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “enterprise” has the same meaning as in paragraph (6) of <ref>section 4502 of title 12</ref>.</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(C) Disclosures of credit scores not obtained from a consumer reporting agency</p>
<p class="indent2">A person that is subject to the provisions of this subsection and that uses a credit score, other than a credit score provided by a consumer reporting agency, may satisfy the obligation to provide a credit score by disclosing a credit score and associated key factors supplied by a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(D) Notice to home loan applicants</p>
<p class="indent2">A copy of the following notice, which shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency providing a credit score that was used:</p>
<p class="centered">
<inline class="small-caps">“notice to the home loan applicant</inline>
</p>
<p class="indent0">“In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.</p>
<p class="indent0">“The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.</p>
<p class="indent0">“Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.</p>
<p class="indent0">“If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.</p>
<p class="indent0">“If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.”.</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(E) Actions not required under this subsection</p>
<p class="indent2">This subsection shall not require any person to—</p>
<p class="indent3">(i) explain the information provided pursuant to subsection (f);</p>
<p class="indent3">(ii) disclose any information other than a credit score or key factors, as defined in subsection (f);</p>
<p class="indent3">(iii) disclose any credit score or related information obtained by the user after a loan has closed;</p>
<p class="indent3">(iv) provide more than 1 disclosure per loan transaction; or</p>
<p class="indent3">(v) provide the disclosure required by this subsection when another person has made the disclosure to the consumer for that loan transaction.</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(F) No obligation for content</p>
<p class="indent5 firstIndent-2">(i) In general</p>
<p class="indent3">The obligation of any person pursuant to this subsection shall be limited solely to providing a copy of the information that was received from the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p class="indent5 firstIndent-2">(ii) Limit on liability</p>
<p class="indent3">No person has liability under this subsection for the content of that information or for the omission of any information within the report provided by the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(G) Person defined as excluding enterprise</p>
<p class="indent2">As used in this subsection, the term “person” does not include an enterprise (as defined in paragraph (6) of <ref>section 4502 of title 12</ref>).</p>
<p class="indent3 firstIndent-2">(2) Prohibition on disclosure clauses null and void</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(A) In general</p>
<p class="indent2">Any provision in a contract that prohibits the disclosure of a credit score by a person who makes or arranges loans or a consumer reporting agency is void.</p>
<p class="indent4 firstIndent-2">(B) No liability for disclosure under this subsection</p>
<p class="indent2">A lender shall not have liability under any contractual provision for disclosure of a credit score pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p class="indent0">This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to electronic fund transfers, dormancy fees, inactivity charges or fees, service fees, or expiration dates of gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. A State law is not inconsistent with this subchapter if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection afforded by this subchapter. The Bureau shall, upon its own motion or upon the request of any financial institution, State, or other interested party, submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Bureau, determine whether a State requirement is inconsistent or affords greater protection. If the Bureau determines that a State requirement is inconsistent, financial institutions shall incur no liability under the law of that State for a good faith failure to comply with that law, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.
