</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Interstate telemarketing fraud has become a problem of such magnitude that the resources of the Federal Trade Commission are not sufficient to ensure adequate consumer protection from such fraud.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> Consumers and others are estimated to lose $40 billion a year in telemarketing fraud.</content>
</paragraph>

<num>(4)</num>
<content> Consumers are victimized by other forms of telemarketing deception and abuse.</content>
</paragraph>
