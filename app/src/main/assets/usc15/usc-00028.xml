<content>
<p class="indent0">With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to issue and have outstanding at any one time, bonds, notes, debentures, and other similar obligations in an aggregate amount not exceeding $30,000,000,000. Such obligations shall be in such forms and denominations, shall have such maturities, shall bear such rates of interest, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall be issued in such manner and sold at such prices as may be prescribed by the Commodity Credit Corporation, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such obligations shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed both as to interest and principal by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face thereof, and such obligations shall be lawful investments and may be accepted as security for all fiduciary, trust, and public funds the investment or deposit of which shall be under the authority or control of the United States or any officer or officers thereof. In the event that the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be unable to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of, or interest on, such obligations, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holder the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, is authorized to purchase any obligations of the Commodity Credit Corporation issued hereunder, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31 and the purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchases of the Commodity Credit Corporation’s obligations hereunder. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the obligations of the Commodity Credit Corporation acquired by him under this section. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of the obligations of the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be treated as public-debt transactions of the United States. No such obligations shall be issued in excess of the assets of the Commodity Credit Corporation, including the assets to be obtained from the proceeds of such obligations, but a failure to comply with this provision shall not invalidate the obligations or the guaranty of the same: <i>Provided</i>, That this sentence shall not limit the authority of the Corporation to issue obligations for the purpose of carrying out its annual budget programs submitted to and approved by the Congress pursuant to chapter 91 of title 31. The Commodity Credit Corporation shall have power to purchase such obligations in the open market at any time and at any price.</p>

<heading> Exchange of surplus agricultural commodities for reserve stocks of strategic materials</heading>
<content>
<p class="indent0">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, has concluded a treaty involving the exchange of surplus agricultural commodities produced in the United States which are held under loans made or made available by the Commodity Credit Corporation for stocks of strategic and critical materials produced abroad, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized, upon terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, to accept such strategic and critical materials in exchange for such surplus agricultural commodities; and for the purpose of such exchange the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Interior acting jointly through the agency of the Munitions Board shall determine which materials are strategic and critical and the quantity and quality of such materials. In order to carry out the provisions of this section, the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized, upon terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, to procure, convey, transport, handle, store, maintain, or rotate such surplus agricultural commodities, and such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials, as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="indent0">The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized and directed to transfer to warehouses in or near cotton manufacturing centers in New England not to exceed three hundred thousand bales of cotton, to which it now has title or may hereafter acquire title, having regard for the grades and staples customarily required by manufacturers in that area: <i>Provided</i>, That all necessary costs in connection with such transfer will not result in additional net cost to the Corporation.</p>
<p class="indent0">In determining specific cotton to be exchanged under this section, the determination shall be made by sampling and selection at the place where the cotton is stored on the date of ratification of a treaty providing for such exchange, and no cotton shall be exchanged under such treaty which, after such date, is transported to another place and there sampled and selected. Such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials shall be stored on military or naval reservations or in other locations approved by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy. The Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to transfer such reserve stocks of strategic and critical materials, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture shall approve, to any other governmental agency. Such reserve stocks or strategic and critical materials shall be made available or disposed of by the Commodity Credit Corporation or other governmental agency only upon order of the President in accordance with the terms of the applicable treaty; when necessary to prevent deterioration, the Commodity Credit Corporation or other governmental agency is authorized to replace those quantities of the reserve stocks of such strategic and critical materials subject to deterioration with equivalent quantities of the same materials. The funds now or hereafter made available to the Commodity Credit Corporation are made available to carry out the purposes of this section. There is authorized to be appropriated such additional sums as may be required to carry out the provisions of this section. All funds for carrying out the provisions of this section shall be available for allotment to bureaus and offices of the Department of Agriculture, and for transfer to such other agencies of the Federal Government as the Secretary of Agriculture may request to cooperate or assist in carrying out the provisions of this section.</p>

To encourage the alleviation of natural resource conservation problems that reduce the productive capacity of the Nation’s land and water resources or that cause degradation of environmental quality, the Corporation may, beginning <date date="1981-12-22">December 22, 1981</date>, make loans to any agricultural producer for those natural resource conservation and environmental enhancement measures that are recommended by the applicable county and State committees established under <ref>section 590h(b) of title 16</ref> and are included in the producer’s conservation plan approved by the local soil and water conservation district; such loans shall be for a period not to exceed ten years at a rate of interest based upon the rate of interest charged the Corporation by the United States Treasury; the Corporation may make loans to any one producer in any fiscal year in an amount not to exceed $25,000; loans up to $10,000 in amount may be unsecured and loans in excess of $10,000 shall be secured; and the total of such unsecured and secured loans made in each fiscal year shall not exceed $200,000,000: <i>Provided</i>, That the authority provided by this sentence to make loans shall be effective only to the extent and in such amounts as may be provided for in prior appropriation Acts. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable, in consultation with the Secretary of State, and upon terms and conditions prescribed or approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, accept strategic and critical materials produced abroad in exchange for agricultural commodities acquired by the Corporation. Insofar as practicable, in effecting such exchange of goods, the Secretary shall: (1) use normal commercial trade channels; (2) take action to avoid displacing usual marketings of United States agricultural commodities and the products thereof; (3) take reasonable precautions to prevent the resale or transshipment to other countries, or use for other than domestic use in the importing country, of agricultural commodities used for such exchange; and (4) give priority to commodities easily storable and those which serve as prime incentive goods to stimulate production of critical and strategic materials. The Corporation may solicit bids from, and utilize, private trading firms to effect such exchange of goods. The determination of the quantities and qualities of such materials which are desirable for stock piling and the determination of which materials are strategic and critical shall be made in the manner prescribed by section 3 of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act [<ref>50 U.S.C. 98b</ref>]. Strategic and critical materials acquired by Commodity Credit Corporation in exchange for agricultural commodities shall, to the extent approved by the President, be transferred to the stock pile provided for by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act [<ref>50 U.S.C. 98</ref> et seq.]; and in the same fiscal year such materials are transferred to the stock pile the Commodity Credit Corporation shall be reimbursed for the strategic and critical materials so transferred to the stock pile from the funds made available for the purpose of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, in an amount equal to the fair market value, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the material transferred to the stock pile. If the volume of petroleum products (including crude oil) stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is less than the level prescribed under <ref>section 6234 of title 42</ref>, the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable and with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, make available annually to the Secretary of Energy, upon the request of the Secretary of Energy, a quantity of agricultural products owned by the Corporation with a market value at the time of such request of at least $300,000,000 for use by the Secretary of Energy in acquiring petroleum products (including crude oil) produced abroad for placement in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through an exchange of such agricultural products. The terms and conditions of each such exchange, including provisions for full reimbursement to the Commodity Credit Corporation, shall be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture. Nothing contained herein shall limit the authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation to acquire, hold, or dispose of such quantity of strategic and critical materials as it deems advisable in carrying out its functions and protecting its assets: <i>Provided</i>, That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, where a grain storage facility owned by the Corporation is not needed by the Corporation and, upon being offered for sale no person offers to pay the minimum price set by the Corporation for such facility for use in connection with storage or handling of agricultural commodities, then the Corporation may, without declaring such facility to be excess property, sell it by bids at not less than such minimum price to any public or private nonprofit agency or organization for use for the purposes of such agency or organization. This provision shall apply also to facilities which on the effective date of this Act have been declared excess to the needs of the Commodity Credit Corporation but have not been claimed by any other Government agency, or surplus to the needs of the Government but not disposed of pursuant to the provisions of chapters 1 to 11 of title 40 and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title 41.</content>
