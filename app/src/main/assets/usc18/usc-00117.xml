<chapeau>Upon a written motion by an individual sentenced to imprisonment or death pursuant to a conviction for a Federal offense (referred to in this section as the “applicant”), the court that entered the judgment of conviction shall order DNA testing of specific evidence if the court finds that all of the following apply:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<chapeau> The applicant asserts, under penalty of perjury, that the applicant is actually innocent of—</chapeau>

<content> the Federal offense for which the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment or death; or</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(B)</num>
<chapeau> another Federal or State offense, if—</chapeau>
<clause class="indent3">
<num>(i)</num>
<content> evidence of such offense was admitted during a Federal sentencing hearing and exoneration of such offense would entitle the applicant to a reduced sentence or new sentencing hearing; and</content>
</clause>
<clause class="indent3">
<num>(ii)</num>
<chapeau> in the case of a State offense—</chapeau>
<subclause class="indent4">
<num>(I)</num>

</subclause>
<subclause class="indent4">
<num>(II)</num>
<content> to the extent available, the applicant has exhausted all remedies available under State law for requesting DNA testing of specified evidence relating to the State offense.</content>

</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(B)</num>
<content> was previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant is requesting DNA testing using a new method or technology that is substantially more probative than the prior DNA testing.</content>
</subparagraph>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> The specific evidence to be tested is in the possession of the Government and has been subject to a chain of custody and retained under conditions sufficient to ensure that such evidence has not been substituted, contaminated, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any respect material to the proposed DNA testing.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> The proposed DNA testing is reasonable in scope, uses scientifically sound methods, and is consistent with accepted forensic practices.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<chapeau> The applicant identifies a theory of defense that—</chapeau>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(A)</num>
<content> is not inconsistent with an affirmative defense presented at trial; and</content>

<content> If the applicant was convicted following a trial, the identity of the perpetrator was at issue in the trial.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<chapeau> The proposed DNA testing of the specific evidence may produce new material evidence that would—</chapeau>

<content> support the theory of defense referenced in paragraph (6); and</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">

<chapeau> There shall be a rebuttable presumption of timeliness if the motion is made within 60 months of enactment of the Justice For All Act of 2004 or within 36 months of conviction, whichever comes later. Such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing—</chapeau>
<clause class="indent3">
<num>(i)</num>
<content> that the applicant’s motion for a DNA test is based solely upon information used in a previously denied motion; or</content>
</clause>
<clause class="indent3">

<content> the evidence to be tested is newly discovered DNA evidence;</content>
</clause>
<clause class="indent3">

<content> that the applicant’s motion is not based solely upon the applicant’s own assertion of innocence and, after considering all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the motion, a denial would result in a manifest injustice; or</content>
