<content> The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to make grants to finance energy conserving improvements (as defined in subparagraph (2) of the last paragraph of <ref>section 1703(a) of title 12</ref>) to projects which are financed with loans under <ref>section 1701q of title 12</ref>, or which are subject to mortgages insured under section 1715<i>l</i>(d)(3) or <ref>section 1715z–1 of title 12</ref>. The Secretary shall make assistance available under this section on a priority basis to those projects which are in financial difficulty as a result of high energy costs. In carrying out the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall issue regulations requiring that any grant made under this section shall be made only on the condition that the recipient of such grant shall take steps (prescribed by the Secretary) to assure that the benefits derived from such grants in terms of lower energy costs shall accrue to tenants in the form of lower rentals or to the Federal Government in the form of a lower operating subsidy if such a subsidy is being paid to such recipient.</content>

<heading> Assistance to Federal agencies in achieving energy efficiency in Federal facilities and operations</heading>
<content>
<p class="indent0">The Secretary in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter, shall continue the process begun in fiscal year 1998 of accepting funds from other Federal agencies in return for assisting agencies in achieving energy efficiency in Federal facilities and operations by the use of privately financed, energy savings performance contracts and other private financing mechanisms. The funds may be provided after agencies begin to realize energy cost savings; may be retained by the Secretary until expended; and may be used only for the purpose of assisting Federal agencies in achieving greater efficiency, water conservation and use of renewable energy by means of privately financed mechanisms, including energy savings performance contracts and utility incentive programs. These recovered funds will continue to be used to administer even greater energy efficiency, water conservation and use of renewable energy by means of privately financed mechanisms such as utility efficiency service contracts and energy savings performance contracts. The recoverable funds will be used for all necessary program expenses, including contractor support and resources needed, to achieve overall Federal energy management program objectives for greater energy savings. Any such privately financed contracts shall meet the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, <ref>Public Law 102–486</ref> regarding energy savings performance contracts and utility incentive programs.</p>
