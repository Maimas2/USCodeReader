<chapeau class="indent0">Congress makes the following findings:</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> Economic projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that by 2018, there could be 2,400,000 unfilled STEM jobs.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Women represent slightly more than half the United States population, and projections indicate that 54 percent of the population will be a member of a racial or ethnic minority group by 2050.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> Despite representing half the population, women comprise only about 30 percent of STEM workers according to a 2015 report by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> A 2014 National Center for Education Statistics study found that underrepresented populations leave the STEM fields at higher rates than their counterparts.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> The representation of women in STEM drops significantly at the faculty level. Overall, women hold only 25 percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 17 percent of full professor positions in STEM fields in our Nation’s universities and 4-year colleges.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> Black and Hispanic faculty together hold about 6.5 percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 5 percent of full professor positions.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> Many of the numbers in the American Indian or Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander categories for different faculty ranks were too small for the Foundation to report publicly without potentially compromising confidential information about the individuals being surveyed.</content>

<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (referred to in this section as the “I-Corps”) was established to foster a national innovation ecosystem by encouraging institutions, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs to identify and explore the innovation and commercial potential of National Science Foundation-funded research well beyond the laboratory.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Through I-Corps, the Foundation invests in entrepreneurship and commercialization education, training, and mentoring that can ultimately lead to the practical deployment of technologies, products, processes, and services that improve the Nation’s competitiveness, promote economic growth, and benefit society.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> By building networks of entrepreneurs, educators, mentors, institutions, and collaborations, and supporting specialized education and training, I-Corps is at the leading edge of a strong, lasting foundation for an American innovation ecosystem.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> By translating federally funded research to a commercial stage more quickly and efficiently, programs like the I-Corps create new jobs and companies, help solve societal problems, and provide taxpayers with a greater return on their investment in research.</content>

<paragraph class="indent1">

To this end, the Congress declares that the highest quality science and engineering over the long-term requires substantial support, from currently available research and educational funds, for increased participation in science and engineering by women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. The Congress further declares that the impact on women, minorities, and persons with disabilities which is produced by advances in science and engineering must be included as essential factors in national and international science, engineering, and economic policies.</content>
