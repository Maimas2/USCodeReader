<heading class="bold"> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">The Congress finds and declares that—</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> the willingness of volunteers to offer their services is deterred by the potential for liability actions against them;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> as a result, many nonprofit public and private organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary associations, social service agencies, educational institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of directors and service in other capacities;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> the contribution of these programs to their communities is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were participating;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-effective social service programs, many of which are national in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and represent some of the most successful public-private partnerships, protection of volunteerism through clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks assumed by the volunteer in connection with such participation is an appropriate subject for Federal legislation;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> services and goods provided by volunteers and nonprofit organizations would often otherwise be provided by private entities that operate in interstate commerce;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation costs, volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher costs in purchasing insurance, through interstate insurance markets, to cover their activities; and</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<chapeau> clarifying and limiting the liability risk assumed by volunteers is an appropriate subject for Federal legislation because—</chapeau>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(A)</num>
<content> of the national scope of the problems created by the legitimate fears of volunteers about frivolous, arbitrary, or capricious lawsuits;</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(B)</num>
<content> the citizens of the United States depend on, and the Federal Government expends funds on, and provides tax exemptions and other consideration to, numerous social programs that depend on the services of volunteers;</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(C)</num>
<content> it is in the interest of the Federal Government to encourage the continued operation of volunteer service organizations and contributions of volunteers because the Federal Government lacks the capacity to carry out all of the services provided by such organizations and volunteers; and</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(D)</num>
<clause class="indent2">
<num>(i)</num>
<content> liability reform for volunteers, will promote the free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate commerce and uphold constitutionally protected due process rights; and</content>
</clause>
<clause class="indent2">
<num>(ii)</num>
<content> therefore, liability reform is an appropriate use of the powers contained in article 1, section 8, clause 3 of the United States Constitution, and the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.</content>
