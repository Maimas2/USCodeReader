<content> Projects may be initiated under this subchapter by the Department of the Navy or Army or the Air Force to provide dwellings on or near naval or military reservations, posts or bases for rental to the officers, enlisted men and employees of the Departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force described in <ref>section 1501 of this title</ref>. Such projects shall be developed by the Department of the Navy or Army or the Air Force or by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, whichever the President determines is better suited to the fulfillment of the purposes of this subchapter with respect to any particular project. If the development of such project is to be undertaken by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to aid the development of the project by furnishing technical assistance and by transferring to such Department the funds necessary for the development of the project. Any project developed for the purpose of this section shall be leased to the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (who shall have title to such project until repayment of the cost thereof to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as prescribed in such lease) upon such terms as shall be prescribed in the lease, which may be the same terms as are authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1937 [<ref>42 U.S.C. 1437</ref> et seq.], with respect to leases to public housing agencies. All the provisions of said Act which apply to the development of projects by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall (insofar as applicable and not inconsistent herewith) apply to the development of projects by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force. Notwithstanding other provisions of this or any other law, the Department leasing a project shall have the same jurisdiction over such project as it has over the reservation, post or base in connection with which the project is developed.</content>

<p class="indent0">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may continue by lease or condemnation any interest less than a fee simple in lands heretofore acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for national defense or war housing or for veterans’ housing (whether of permanent or temporary character), or held by any Federal agency in connection therewith, and may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, a fee simple title to or lesser interest in any such lands if the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that the acquisition of such fee simple or lesser interest is necessary to protect the Government’s investment or to maintain the improvements constructed thereon, or that the cost of fulfilling the Government’s obligation to restore the property to its original condition would equal or exceed the cost of acquiring the title thereto.</p>
<p class="indent0">In any city in which, on <date date="1953-03-01">March 1, 1953</date>, there were more than ten thousand temporary housing units held by the United States of America, or any two contiguous cities in one of which there were on such date more than ten thousand temporary housing units so held, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, a fee simple title to any or all lands in which the Secretary holds a leasehold interest, or other interest less than a fee simple, acquired by the Federal Government for national defense or war housing or for veteran’s housing where (1) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development finds that the acquisition by the Secretary of a fee simple title in the land will tend to expedite the orderly disposal or removal of temporary housing under the Secretary’s jurisdiction by facilitating the availability of improved sites for privately owned housing needed to replace such temporary housing, and will tend to expedite the transition of the city from a war-affected community containing, as of said date, a large number of temporary houses to a community having additional permanent, well-planned, residential neighborhoods, (2) the local governing body of the city makes a like finding and requests the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to acquire such title to the land, and (3) the city has furnished assurances satisfactory to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that no individual who is employed by, or is an official of, the government of the city in which the land is located, or any agency thereof, shall be permitted, directly or indirectly, to have any financial interest in the purchase or redevelopment of such land: <i>Provided</i>, That such acquisitions by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this sentence shall be limited to not exceeding four hundred and twenty-five acres of land in the general area in which approximately one thousand five hundred units of temporary housing held by the United States of America were unoccupied on said date: <i>And provided further</i>, That funds for such acquisition by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which are authorized, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and title II of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1955, to be expended from the revolving fund established by <ref>section 1701g–5 of title 12</ref>, shall be taken into consideration, to the extent that they are needed, in making any determination pursuant to the second proviso under that section. All or any part of any land so acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, during the five year period following the date of its acquisition, be sold by the Secretary, through negotiated sale, to such city or any local public agency where (1) the city or local public agency has represented to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that it is duly authorized under State law to purchase and resell such land, that such land will be made available to private enterprise for development in accordance with local zoning and other laws, and that the aggregate of such land and any other land in the same city previously sold under the authority of this paragraph to the city or a local public agency will be developed for predominantly residential use, and (2) the city or local public agency has agreed to pay the fair market value of the land as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, after giving consideration, among other relevant information, to the cost to the Federal Government of acquiring the fee simple title and of holding the land pending sale (including estimated amounts to cover legal and overhead expenses of such acquisition and to cover interest costs to the Federal Government of monies invested in the land pending sale). Any such negotiated sale of land to the city or a local public agency shall be made upon terms which require (1) that the city or public agency shall pay in cash at least one third of the price of the land upon its conveyance and the entire price within one year after its conveyance and (2) that any portion of the entire price not paid upon such conveyance shall be represented by an indebtedness which shall bear interest on outstanding balances at a rate of 4 per centum per annum and which shall be secured by a first mortgage lien upon the land or such portion of the land as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development deems adequate to protect the financial interest of the Federal Government. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, at any time that the Secretary deems it to be in the public interest to do so, dispose, under authority of other provisions of subchapters II to VII of this chapter, of any land acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this paragraph. Any land acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this paragraph which has not been disposed of within five years after its acquisition shall be disposed of by the Secretary as expeditiously as possible in the public interest in accordance with other authority contained in subchapters II to VII of this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of <ref>section 1546 of this title</ref> or any other provisions of law, no payments in lieu of taxes shall be made for any tax year beginning subsequent to the date of the acquisition of title to the property by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>

<p class="indent0">Whenever the Secretary of Defense or his designee determines that it is desirable in order to effectuate the purposes of this title, the Secretary is authorized, without regard to the civil service and classification laws, to procure, by negotiation or otherwise, the services of architects and engineers, or organizations thereof, under such arrangements as he deems desirable, but at an expense not in excess of that permissible under the schedule of fees allowed from time to time by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in connection with projects assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended [<ref>42 U.S.C. 1437</ref> et seq.]. Such services may include the development of plans, drawings and specifications for family housing under this title and other services in connection therewith: <i>Provided</i>, That such plans, drawings, and specifications may include the use of any project to be constructed under this subchapter of alternate materials or alternate types of construction, including prefabrication, that provide substantially equal value and conform to standards established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: <i>Provided further</i>, That such plans, drawings, and specifications, when developed pursuant to arrangements made under this section after <date date="1956-08-07">August 7, 1956</date>, shall follow the principle of modular measure, in order that the housing may be built by conventional construction, on-site fabrication, factory precutting, factory fabrication, or any combination of these construction methods: <i>Provided further</i>, That the Secretary of Defense may designate certain sites or parts thereof for family housing to be furnished from prefabricated houses or housing components. Such arrangements may include provision for advance or progress payments, for payment by third parties, for payment by the Government of any such compensation as it not paid for by third parties, and shall include provision for reimbursement by third parties to the Government of any compensation or other expenses paid by the Government pursuant to this section, and may include other provisions for compensation. Any public works appropriations now or hereafter available to the Departments of the Army, Navy, or Air Force or the Coast Guard may be obligated by the respective departments or the Coast Guard for these purposes. Reimbursements to the Government on account of payments made pursuant to this section shall be made to appropriations against which such payments were charged. The Secretary of Defense is further authorized to advance or pay to the Department of Housing and Urban Development its “Appraisal and Eligibility Statement” fees in connection with such family housing. The Secretary of Defense is further authorized to enter into arrangements by contract or otherwise for eventual acquisition by the Government, without cost to the Government of all right, title, and interest in sites on which housing is constructed pursuant to this title and improvements thereon.</p>
