<num>(1)</num>
<content> It is in the best interest of our Nation to preserve, strengthen, and maintain the family.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> Families of children with disabilities provide support, care, and training to their children that can save States millions of dollars. Without the efforts of family caregivers, many persons with disabilities would receive care through State-supported out-of-home placements.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> Most families of children with disabilities, especially families in unserved and underserved populations, do not have access to family-centered and family-directed services to support such families in their efforts to care for such children at home.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> Medical advances and improved health care have increased the life span of many people with disabilities, and the combination of the longer life spans and the aging of family caregivers places a continually increasing demand on the finite service delivery systems of the States.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> In 1996, 49 States provided family support initiatives in response to the needs of families of children with disabilities. Such initiatives included the provision of cash subsidies, respite care, and other forms of support. There is a need in each State, however, to strengthen, expand, and coordinate the activities of a system of family support services for families of children with disabilities that is easily accessible, avoids duplication, uses resources efficiently, and prevents gaps in services to families in all areas of the State.</content>
