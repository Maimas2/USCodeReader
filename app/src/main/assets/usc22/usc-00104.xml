<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of Iran, combined with its development of unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles and its support for international terrorism, represent a threat to the security of the United States, its strong ally Israel, and other allies of the United States around the world.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> The United States and other responsible countries have a vital interest in working together to prevent the Government of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly called attention to Iran’s illicit nuclear activities and, as a result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions designed to encourage the Government of Iran to suspend those activities and comply with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow <date date="1968-07-01">July 1, 1968</date>, and entered into force <date date="1970-03-05">March 5, 1970</date> (commonly known as the “Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty”).</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>

</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> The United States and its major European allies, including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have advocated that sanctions be strengthened should international diplomatic efforts fail to achieve verifiable suspension of Iran’s uranium enrichment program and an end to its nuclear weapons program and other illicit nuclear activities.</content>

<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(A)</num>
<content> Iran’s apparent rejection of the Tehran Research Reactor plan, generously offered by the United States and its partners, of potentially great benefit to the people of Iran, and endorsed by Iran’s own negotiators in October 2009.</content>
</subparagraph>
<subparagraph class="indent2">
<num>(B)</num>
<content> Iran’s ongoing clandestine nuclear program, as evidenced by its work on the secret uranium enrichment facility at Qom, its subsequent refusal to cooperate fully with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, and its announcement that it would build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities.</content>

<content> On <date date="2011-11-21">November 21, 2011</date>, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a finding under <ref>section 5318A of title 31</ref> that identified Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.</content>

<num>(2)</num>
<content> In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury wrote, “The Central Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has assisted designated Iranian banks by transferring billions of dollars to these banks in 2011. In mid-2011, the CBI transferred several billion dollars to designated banks, including Saderat, Mellat, EDBI and Melli, through a variety of payment schemes. In making these transfers, the CBI attempted to evade sanctions by minimizing the direct involvement of large international banks with both CBI and designated Iranian banks.”.</content>
