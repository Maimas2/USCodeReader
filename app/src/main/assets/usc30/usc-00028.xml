<heading class="bold"> Findings</heading>
<chapeau class="indent0">The Congress finds that—</chapeau>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(1)</num>
<content> the United States’ requirements for hard minerals to satisfy national industrial needs will continue to expand and the demand for such minerals will increasingly exceed the available domestic sources of supply;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(2)</num>
<content> in the case of certain hard minerals, the United States is dependent upon foreign sources of supply and the acquisition of such minerals from foreign sources is a significant factor in the national balance-of-payments position;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(3)</num>
<content> the present and future national interest of the United States requires the availability of hard mineral resources which is independent of the export policies of foreign nations;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(4)</num>
<content> there is an alternate source of supply, which is significant in relation to national needs, of certain hard minerals, including nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese, contained in the nodules existing in great abundance on the deep seabed;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(5)</num>
<content> the nations of the world, including the United States, will benefit if the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed beyond limits of national jurisdiction can be developed and made available for their use;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(6)</num>
<content> in particular, future access to the nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese resources of the deep seabed will be important to the industrial needs of the nations of the world, both developed and developing;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(7)</num>
<content> on <date date="1970-12-17">December 17, 1970</date>, the United States supported (by affirmative vote) the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2749 (XXV) declaring inter alia the principle that the mineral resources of the deep seabed are the common heritage of mankind, with the expectation that this principle would be legally defined under the terms of a comprehensive international Law of the Sea Treaty yet to be agreed upon;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(8)</num>
<content> it is in the national interest of the United States and other nations to encourage a widely acceptable Law of the Sea Treaty, which will provide a new legal order for the oceans covering a broad range of ocean interests, including exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(9)</num>
<content> the negotiations to conclude such a Treaty and establish the international regime governing the exercise of rights over, and exploration of, the resources of the deep seabed, referred to in General Assembly Resolution 2749 (XXV) are in progress but may not be concluded in the near future;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(10)</num>
<content> even if such negotiations are completed promptly, much time will elapse before such an international regime is established and in operation;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(11)</num>
<content> development of technology required for the exploration and recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed will require substantial investment for many years before commercial production can occur, and must proceed at this time if deep seabed minerals are to be available when needed;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(12)</num>
<content> it is the legal opinion of the United States that exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed are freedoms of the high seas subject to a duty of reasonable regard to the interests of other states in their exercise of those and other freedoms recognized by general principles of international law;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(13)</num>
<content> pending a Law of the Sea Treaty, and in the absence of agreement among states on applicable principles of international law, the uncertainty among potential investors as to the future legal regime is likely to discourage or prevent the investments necessary to develop deep seabed mining technology;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(14)</num>
<content> pending a Law of the Sea Treaty, the protection of the marine environment from damage caused by exploration or recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed depends upon the enactment of suitable interim national legislation;</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(15)</num>
<content> a Law of the Sea Treaty is likely to establish financial arrangements which obligate the United States or United States citizens to make payments to an international organization with respect to exploration or recovery of the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed; and</content>
</paragraph>
<paragraph class="indent1">
<num>(16)</num>
<content> legislation is required to establish an interim legal regime under which technology can be developed and the exploration and recovery of the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed can take place until such time as a Law of the Sea Treaty enters into force with respect to the United States.</content>
